      <h1>Why I'm Learning to Program at 30</h1>
      <h2>...and what I love about it so far.</h2>

               <h2>Backstory</h2>
                  <p>
                     Up until recently my career plan looked something like this:
                     <ol>
                        <li>Finish my PhD</li>
                        <li>Get a job as a professor</li>
                        <li>Continue to write and publish</li>
                        <li>Get a better job in a place I actually like</li>
                        <li>Write my magnum opus</li>
                        <li>Revolutionize my field and be remembered after I die</li>
                     </ol>
                     Simple, right? Well, as you might guess there were problems with this plan. My naive college-self was excited about philosophy and ethics and thought I wouldn't be happy doing anything else. I was committed to changing the world with my ideas and teaching. I didn't consider how my laser-focused career goals might be incompatible with my other needs and wants in life.

                     In the course of my PhD program I met and married my husband, had our daughter, and lived through a pandemic. I made wonderful friends and built a strong community in Saint Louis. So many aspects of my life blossomed... except my career. My priorities had radically changed and I no longer felt the same passion I had when I started the program. I no longer cared to write a magnum opus. I thought something was wrong with me since I no longer fit in the academic mold, but I eventually realized that the demands of academia would take away from other valuable aspects of my life.

                  <p>It was time for a career change.</p>

               <h2>My Turn to Tech</h2>
                  <p>I want a career that:
                     <ol>
                        <li>I enjoy</li>
                        <li>Is challenging enough that I don't get bored</li>
                        <li>Is compatible with my lifestyle</li>
                        <li>Supports my family financially</li>
                     </ol>
                     After doing some research and talking to other ex-academics who went through <a href="https://www.launchcode.org/">LaunchCode</a>, I was pretty certain a job in software or web development was the path for me. I've always loved math, problem-solving, and computers. Furthermore, it can offer me the work-life balance and salary I need to support my family. Honestly, I don't know why it took me so long to pursue this path!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     I had only done a very small amount of coding before applying for and starting LaunchCode. Some folks questioned if I was jumping in too fast without knowing if I would like it. Their concerns didn't end up holding water - I've <strong>loved</strong> programming so far. I'm able to stay focused and motivated when working on problems. With each new lesson I feel one step closer to a career in tech.

                     A turning point for me was completing the Roman Numeral Converter bonus project. Not only did I make it work, I found a different (and I think better) method than the solution provided. More importantly, I stuck with it through the difficult, challenging moments where I wasn't sure I would complete it. After having my confidence broken down by academia for years, I finally felt it building back up.

               <h2>Moving Forward</h2>
                  <p>
                     I'm still in the midst of learning programming through <a href="https://www.launchcode.org/women-plus">LaunchCode's Women+ program</a>. I'm also doing some additional learning on my own in order to be prepared for a job. It's difficult making a career change and feeling behind - it's easy to get down on yourself for not starting earlier or knowing as much as those with degrees in computer science. I just try to remind myself that my process is my own. Even though I'm starting my tech journey later, I have so much life and professional experience I can bring into my future.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     I'm excited to get my first job in tech. I'm excited to learn more and find the specific direction I want to pursue - senior developer, team leader, data scientist, or maybe cybersecurity? Tech is an excited and ever-changing industry, and I'm stoked to be part of it.
